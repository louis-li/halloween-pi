Halloween Pumpkin Pi project

New update: 2018-11-04

This version is based on Lightshow PI: https://togiles@bitbucket.org/togiles/lightshowpi.git

With a solid state power relay, it could control up to 8 lights, see one example here: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6463594323635163136

I also edited some spooky music to be 30-45 seconds long, with motion sensor, it will be a surprise Halloween music lightshow.
